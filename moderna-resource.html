        <li>Transformative Impact: Striving to make a significant and lasting impact on public health worldwide.</li>
        <li>Integrity and Quality: Holding high standards in scientific rigor, clinical trials, and product development to ensure safe and effective therapies.</li>
        <li>Accountability: Ensuring that everyone at Moderna takes responsibility for their contributions to the company’s mission and its potential impact on global health.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Company Background and Milestones</h2>
    <p>2010: Founded by Noubar Afeyan, Stéphane Bancel, and other co-founders, Moderna focuses on mRNA technology as a foundation for drug development.<br>
    2015-2017: Moderna establishes itself as a leader in mRNA science, building a robust pipeline across infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, and rare diseases.<br>
    2018: The company goes public, marking a major milestone in its growth as a biopharmaceutical leader.<br>
    2020: Moderna becomes globally recognized for its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, which receives emergency use authorization (EUA) in record time.<br>
    2021 and Beyond: Building on its mRNA platform, Moderna expands its research to other infectious diseases, cancer, rare diseases, and personalized vaccines.</p>

    <h2>4. Key Products and Research Areas</h2>
    <p>Moderna’s work extends beyond vaccines; the company is using mRNA technology to explore treatments for a range of conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273):</strong> The world’s first widely distributed mRNA vaccine for COVID-19, Moderna's vaccine was a breakthrough, showcasing the potential of mRNA technology.</li>
        <li><strong>mRNA Vaccines for Other Infectious Diseases:</strong> Moderna is working on vaccines for diseases like influenza, Zika, and HIV, using mRNA to produce antigens that stimulate the immune system.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancer Vaccines and Immuno-Oncology:</strong> Personalized cancer vaccines are in development to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, tailored to each patient’s tumor.</li>
        <li><strong>Rare Disease Treatments:</strong> Moderna is developing treatments for conditions that have limited options, such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA), using mRNA to address genetic deficiencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular and Autoimmune Therapies:</strong> The company is exploring mRNA-based approaches to stimulate healing in cardiovascular diseases and to address autoimmune conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Technology and Innovation</h2>
    <p>Moderna’s core innovation lies in its proprietary mRNA platform, which allows the company to produce a wide array of therapeutic candidates quickly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>mRNA Platform:</strong> mRNA, or messenger RNA, acts as a set of instructions for cells to produce proteins. Moderna’s platform harnesses this mechanism to create proteins that can either stimulate an immune response (in vaccines) or correct protein deficiencies (in gene therapies).</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery Systems:</strong> Moderna has developed lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA safely to cells. These particles protect the mRNA from degradation and ensure it reaches its target.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Vaccines and Therapies:</strong> For conditions like cancer, Moderna can design mRNA sequences unique to a patient’s tumor. This approach, combined with machine learning and AI, allows for targeted treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical-Scale Manufacturing:</strong> Moderna’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities allow for rapid production and scalability, which was instrumental in its COVID-19 vaccine distribution.</li>
    </ul>
